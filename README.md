This is a simple soundboard coded in python that alllow you to play the sounds you want.

To use this you need to create the folders "sounds/page_1 | page_2 | page_3"

The imported files need to be in .wav format and have two channels to work.

Add your sounds in the folder you want to have them apprear in a given slot.
